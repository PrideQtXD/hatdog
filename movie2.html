        <p>Paul Edgecomb walked the mile while carrying a number of drawbacks. He had never met somebody like John Coffey, a large black man who had been found guilty of viciously killing two young sisters. Coffey lacked the temperament, but he was big and strong enough to kill anyone. Beyond his innocent simplicity and terrifying terror of the dark, Coffey appeared to have a vast, magical talent. Paul started to wonder if Coffey was really responsible for the deaths of the two girls.
